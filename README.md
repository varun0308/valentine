# Valentine's Day Surprise â€“ A Streamlit Love App

This is a personalized Valentine's Day project I built using Python and Streamlit. It's a heartfelt web app designed that I created; a fun, emotional, and meaningful experience for someone very special.

## About this app

1. **Riddle-Based Login**  
   Has a custom poetic riddle as the entry point. Only the two of us know the backstory and can answer it correctly :)

2. **Love Graph**  
   A dynamic graph visualizes how feelings have grown over time, with peaks on special dates(and a special surprise).

3. **A game of Pinpoint**
   We used to play Pinpoint from LinkedIn, I made a replica of that game!

3. **Wholesome Surprises**
   A few warm messages, animations, and small surprises that make the experience memorable.

## Inspiration

Long distances can be hard, and this was a nice gesture to birdge the gap and take the mind off of everything else. Inspired by a shared journey and built as a digital keepsake to celebrate it.

## Access

This app is private and meant for one person only xD
